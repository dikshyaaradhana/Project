Inventory Management - Supply Forecasting

Inaccurate sales forecast is proving to be costly to an organization as inventory purchases for any company as they are tied to forecasted sales. Low inventory levels have resulted in placing rush order to the vendor. Likewise, over stocking is costing the company as cash sits idle and heldup in inventory. According to a case study, there is a growing concern on the inventory levels that the company holds for which the sales forecastanalysis is done.
Using Time Series Analysis to forecast sales for the coming period will accurately determine the gross sales per day which is the dependent variable in the analysis. The time period among others form part of the independent variables. This will allow the company to get rid of costly rush orders and uneven level ofinventory and at the same time meet normal production levels.
